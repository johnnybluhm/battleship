Brief Description of the project:

The project is a modified version of the classic game Battleship, using the coding language Java to create it. The player will play virtually against a computer controlled opponent. All of the classic rules apply - you have the ability to place your ships down on a grid and the ability to attack your opponent’s grid. The goal of the game is the same as well, to sink all of your opponent’s ships before they sink yours! There are also some additional features that were developed as time went by which are explained further under “User Stories” below. Players have two special power ups: an airstrike and a sonar pulse. The players are also able to move their ships after they have been placed. In case a player places a ship down in the wrong place, moves their fleet, attacks a point on the grid, or uses their airstrike somewhere they did not mean to, there is a feature that allows them to undo their actions (and redo them if they want to go back to how things were). Storms will also randomly appear on the board and can sink a player’s ship if big enough. 

It is also worth noting that this project was specifically made for the course CSCI 4448/5448 at CU Boulder in the Spring semester of the 2020/2021 school year in order to learn Object-Oriented Design. The goal of the project was to create a working game of Battleship, yes, but also to find a way to incorporate different coding patterns (taken from the book Head First Design Patterns, second edition) into a simple coding base as well as learn how to refactor code.
